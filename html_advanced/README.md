# Webpage Structure Project

## Overview
In this project I will use advanced html to build a webpage from a designer file.
I am focusing on creating the **HTML STRUCTURE ONLY** without styling using css, just pure semantic HTML.
I will be learning to translate a visual design into code by carefully mapping out the HTML tags that represent the content and layout of the provided design.

## Objectives
- Practice writing clean HTML code
- Learn how to break down a design into proper HTML elements.
- Understand how structure and meaning work with design.
